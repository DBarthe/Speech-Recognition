when we took our seats at the breakfast table it was with the feeling of being no longer looked upon as connected in any way with this case (3081-166546-0000)
instantly they absorbed all my attention though i dared not give them a direct look and continued to observe them only in the glass (3081-166546-0001)
yes and a very respectable one (3081-166546-0002)
the lady is not the mother of the boys but their aunt (3081-166546-0003)
the boys belong to the gentleman who is a widower (3081-166546-0004)
george nodded (3081-166546-0005)
the boys look wide awake enough if the father does not (3081-166546-0006)
do they still insist that miss challoner was the only person in the room with them at this time (3081-166546-0007)
george (3081-166546-0008)
have you ever thought that she might have been a suicide (3081-166546-0009)
i know it sounds foolish but the alternative is so improbable (3081-166546-0010)
the boys look wide awake enough but who can tell i would sooner believe that (3081-166546-0011)
a man was looking in from the corridor behind at the four persons we were just discussing (3081-166546-0012)
i inquired of george with my eyes still on this furtive watcher (3081-166546-0013)
i took quite a fancy to him why (3081-166546-0014)
i am looking at him now (3081-166546-0015)
just an everyday detective but ambitious i suppose and quite alive to the importance of being thorough (3081-166546-0016)
yes he's mercurial in all his movements (3081-166546-0017)
what does he want (3081-166546-0018)
i asked as soon as george had returned to my side (3081-166546-0019)
he wants me to stand ready to obey any summons the police may send me (3081-166546-0020)
i emphasised complacently (3081-166546-0021)
he appeared to know for he told me at once that he was detective gryce a man who had grown old in solving just such baffling problems as these (3081-166546-0022)
he gave up work some time ago i have been told my husband went on but evidently a great case still has its allurement for him (3081-166546-0023)
the trail here must be a very blind one for them to call him in (3081-166546-0024)
i wish we had not left so soon (3081-166546-0025)
he was late of course but when he did appear i almost forgot our usual greeting in my hurry to ask him if he had seen the evening papers (3081-166546-0026)
however a little later we had a comfortable chat (3081-166546-0027)
it was one which gave me a small triumph over george (3081-166546-0028)
the suggestion he had laughed at was not so entirely foolish as he had been pleased to consider it (3081-166546-0029)
their greeting was cordial and the lines on the latter's face relaxed a little as he met the still bright eye of the man upon whose instinct and judgment so much reliance had always been placed (3081-166546-0030)
this is very good of you he began glancing down at the aged detective's bundled up legs and gently pushing a chair towards him (3081-166546-0031)
it's the most inexplicable there (3081-166546-0032)
but clews there are absolutely none (3081-166546-0033)
that is we have not been able to find any perhaps you can (3081-166546-0034)
at least that is what we hope (3081-166546-0035)
it's a case in a thousand gryce (3081-166546-0036)
the old man's eyes shot fire and unconsciously one foot slipped to the floor (3081-166546-0037)
she had no companion near her (3081-166546-0038)
no word no cry just a collapse and sudden fall (3081-166546-0039)
in olden days they would have said struck by a bolt from heaven (3081-166546-0040)
what do you make of it gryce (3081-166546-0041)
i should like to see the desk you speak of and the spot where she fell (3081-166546-0042)
a young fellow who had been hovering in the background at once stepped forward (3081-166546-0043)
he was the plain faced detective who had spoken to george (3081-166546-0044)
this sweetwater as they called him was i have since understood one of his proteges and more or less of a favourite (3081-166546-0045)
been over the ground studied the affair carefully (3081-166546-0046)
very well then you're in a position to pioneer me (3081-166546-0047)
well well that's honest at all events (3081-166546-0048)
but i'm in no position to make promises (3081-166546-0049)
old days don't return for the asking (3081-166546-0050)
whether he got anything else it would be impossible to say from his manner as he finally sank into a chair by one of the openings and looked down on the lobby below (3081-166546-0051)
one or two of the musicians from the end of the hall (3081-166546-0052)
naturally they reached her first (3081-166546-0053)
honest germans men who have played here for years (3081-166546-0055)
who came next on the scene some people from the lobby (3081-166546-0056)
anybody before the father came in (3081-166546-0057)
i suppose she has been carefully questioned very i should say (3081-166546-0059)
and she speaks of no weapon (3081-166546-0060)
not till the doctor came her doctor who was happily in his office in this very building (3081-166546-0061)
yes mister slater the assistant manager who was in the lobby at the time says that ten minutes at least must have elapsed (3081-166546-0062)
no doubt (3081-166546-0063)
sweetwater someone drew that weapon out (3081-166546-0064)
not altogether by me (3081-166546-0065)
wherever she pleases only i can't walk far (3081-166546-0066)
it has not been running since last night or it would be full of curious people all the time hustling to get a glimpse of this place (3081-166546-0067)
but they'll put a man on for you (3081-166546-0068)
very good manage it as you will (3081-166546-0069)
i'll wait here till you're ready explain yourself to the lady tell her i'm an old and rheumatic invalid who has been used to asking his own questions (3081-166546-0070)
as her quiet figure appeared in the doorway sweetwater stole a glance at mister gryce (3081-166546-0071)
there was no doubting them in this instance (3081-166546-0072)
yes (3081-166546-0073)
for some little time that is it seemed long though i believe it was not more than a minute before two men came running from the musicians gallery (3081-166546-0074)
yes many times (3081-166546-0075)
what made the difference (3081-166546-0076)
miss clarke started and her sweet face showed a moment's perplexity did i she queried musingly (3081-166546-0077)
no a very natural one i should say (3081-166546-0078)
and the glance she cast him while not meeting his eye showed that she understood the importance of the admission (3081-166546-0079)
i know she said what you are going to ask me now (3081-166546-0080)
there was no poniard in the wound (3081-166546-0081)
the time is narrowed down to one and in that one miss clarke was the only person to touch her (3081-166546-0082)
i will trouble you no further (3081-166546-0083)
sweetwater help me out of this (3081-166546-0084)
but vigour returned to him before he had well reached the door and he showed some of his old spirit as he thanked miss clarke and turned to take the elevator (3081-166546-0085)
the next minute she was in this lady's arms (3081-166546-0086)
no weapon protruded from the wound nor was any found on or near her in the mezzanine what follows (3081-166546-0087)
she struck the blow herself and the strength of purpose which led her to do this gave her the additional force to pull the weapon out and fling it from her (3081-166546-0088)
it did not fall upon the floor around her therefore it flew through one of those openings into the lobby and there it either will be or has been found (3081-166546-0089)
with an education which ought to have ensured me an honourable standing in the world with some intelligence wit good literary and scientific knowledge and endowed with those accidental physical qualities which are such a good passport into society i found myself at the age of twenty the mean follower of a sublime art in which if great talent is rightly admired mediocrity is as rightly despised (3170-137482-0000)
i was compelled by poverty to become a member of a musical band in which i could expect neither esteem nor consideration and i was well aware that i should be the laughing stock of the persons who had known me as a doctor in divinity as an ecclesiastic and as an officer in the army and had welcomed me in the highest society (3170-137482-0001)
i felt that in my first profession as i was not blessed with the vocation necessary to it i should have succeeded only by dint of hypocrisy and i should have been despicable in my own estimation even if i had seen the purple mantle on my shoulders for the greatest dignities cannot silence a man's own conscience (3170-137482-0002)
besides i was of opinion that a man's profession whatever it might be ought to supply him with enough money to satisfy all his wants and the very poor pay of an officer would never have been sufficient to cover my expenses because my education had given me greater wants than those of officers in general (3170-137482-0003)
our scandalous proceedings often exposed us to the greatest danger (3170-137482-0004)
we would very often spend the whole night rambling about the city inventing and carrying into execution the most impertinent practical jokes (3170-137482-0005)
we did the same with physicians whom we often sent half dressed to some nobleman who was enjoying excellent health (3170-137482-0006)
whenever we could contrive to get into a church tower we thought it great fun to frighten all the parish by ringing the alarm bell as if some fire had broken out but that was not all we always cut the bell ropes so that in the morning the churchwardens had no means of summoning the faithful to early mass (3170-137482-0007)
this is the amusing adventure which closed our exploits (3170-137482-0008)
yet there are a few private rooms which contain a table surrounded with benches in which a respectable family or a few friends can enjoy themselves in a decent way (3170-137482-0010)
we took our three prisoners to a large boat (3170-137482-0012)
where is my husband (3170-137482-0013)
never fear you shall see him again to morrow (3170-137482-0014)
my readers may imagine whether we felt inclined to laugh when the charming creature bade us good night thanking us all with perfect good faith (3170-137482-0015)
two days afterwards our nocturnal orgy began to be talked of (3170-137482-0016)
it went on to say that the two men who had carried her off had taken her to such a place where they had an hour later been met by the other six and that they had all repaired to the two swords where they had spent an hour in drinking (3170-137482-0017)
there was no cowardly traitor amongst us although we were all poor but fear had its effect and our nocturnal pranks were not renewed (3170-137482-0018)
i picked it up and coming up to him just as he was going down the steps i handed it to him (3170-137482-0019)
i told him and he insisted upon my coming with him in the gondola saying that he would leave me at my house (3170-137482-0020)
i rubbed it with all my strength but he told me in a sort of indistinct whisper that the numbness was spreading all along the left side and that he was dying (3170-137482-0021)
taking everything upon myself i ordered a servant to hurry out for a physician who came in a short time and ordered the patient to be bled again thus approving the first bleeding prescribed by me (3170-137482-0023)
thinking i had a right to watch the sick man i settled myself near his bed to give him every care he required (3170-137482-0024)
they did not know who i was and did not like to ask me whilst i thought it better to preserve a modest silence (3170-137482-0025)
he had gambled and lost a great deal and his brother was his most bitter enemy because he was infatuated with the idea that he had tried to poison him (3170-137482-0026)
the physician who attended him was named terro he thought by some peculiar train of reasoning that he could cure him by applying a mercurial ointment to the chest to which no one raised any objection (3170-137482-0027)
delighted with such a fortunate result we lay down again (3170-137482-0028)
he entreated me to tell him the truth (3170-137482-0029)
what extraordinary things will sometimes occur from mere chance or from the force of circumstances (3170-137482-0030)
unwilling to hurt his vanity by telling him that he was mistaken i took the wild resolution of informing him in the presence of his two friends that i possessed a certain numeral calculus which gave answers also in numbers to any questions i liked to put (3170-137482-0031)
i obeyed implicitly and met your excellency (3170-137482-0032)
the three friends were astounded (3170-137482-0033)
i declared myself quite willing for it was necessary to brazen it out after having ventured as far as i had done (3170-137482-0034)
he wrote the question and gave it to me i read it i could not understand either the subject or the meaning of the words but it did not matter i had to give an answer (3170-137482-0035)
if the question was so obscure that i could not make out the sense of it it was natural that i should not understand the answer (3170-137482-0036)
they all asked me how long i would require to teach them the rules of my sublime calculus (3170-137482-0037)
not very long i answered and i will teach you as you wish although the hermit assured me that i would die suddenly within three days if i communicated my science to anyone but i have no faith whatever in that prediction (3170-137482-0038)
they believed that through me they possessed the philosopher's stone the universal panacea the intercourse with all the elementary heavenly and infernal spirits they had no doubt whatever that thanks to my sublime science they could find out the secrets of every government in europe (3170-137482-0039)
but although believing fully in my oracles they were too kind hearted to think them the work of the devil and it suited their natural goodness better to believe my answers inspired by some heavenly spirit (3170-137482-0040)
they were not only good christians and faithful to the church but even real devotees and full of scruples (3170-137482-0041)
as for the eucharist transubstantiation the real presence it was all no mystery to them but palpable evidence and yet they were not jesuits (3170-137482-0042)
i might be told that if i had wished to follow the rules of pure morality i ought either to have declined intimate intercourse with them or to have undeceived them (3170-137482-0043)
besides i found it very flattering to my vanity to become the subject of the speculative chattering of empty fools who having nothing else to do are always trying to find out the cause of every moral phenomenon they meet with which their narrow intellect cannot understand (3170-137482-0044)
whoever you may be i am indebted to you for my life (3170-137482-0045)
your apartment is ready you may send your clothes you shall have a servant a gondola at your orders my own table and ten sequins a month (3170-137482-0046)
you need not think of the future think only of enjoying yourself and take me as your adviser in everything that may happen to you in everything you may wish to undertake and you may be certain of always finding me your friend (3170-137482-0047)
i threw myself at his feet to assure him of my gratitude and embraced him calling him my father (3170-137482-0048)
her meeting with letty was indescribably tender and the days that followed were pretty equally divided between her and her brother in nursing the one and loving the other (3853-163249-0000)
but even while she enjoyed every hour of life and begrudged the time given to sleep she felt as if the dream was too beautiful to last and often said (3853-163249-0001)
so christie turned a deaf ear to her prophetic soul and gave herself up to the blissful holiday that had come at last (3853-163249-0002)
nothing can surprise me now i'm prepared for any thing even the sight of my quakerish lover dancing a jig (3853-163249-0003)
i feel like a boy out of school or rather a man out of prison and must enjoy my liberty in some way (3853-163249-0004)
i'm not a talker you know and as the laws of gravitation forbid my soaring aloft anywhere i can only express my joyfully uplifted state of mind by prancing as you call it (3853-163249-0005)
i don't want you to i love to see you so young and happy only you are not the old david and i've got to get acquainted with the new one (3853-163249-0006)
i hope you'll like him better than the frost bitten old david you first knew and were kind enough to love (3853-163249-0007)
mother says i've gone back to the time before we lost letty and i sometimes feel as if i had (3853-163249-0008)
in that case you will find me a proud impetuous ambitious fellow christie and how will that suit (3853-163249-0009)
excellently i like pride of your sort impetuosity becomes you for you have learned to control it if need be and the ambition is best of all (3853-163249-0010)
i shall wait for time to show (3853-163249-0011)
then they went back to their work little dreaming as they tied roses and twined smilax wreaths how near that other chance was how soon they were to be called upon to keep their promise and how well each was to perform the part given them in life and death (3853-163249-0012)
to no home in the land did the great trouble bring a more sudden change than the little cottage in the lane (3853-163249-0013)
david was sober enough now and went about his work with a grim set to his lips and a spark in his eyes that made the three women look at one another pale with unspoken apprehension (3853-163249-0014)
it is terrible and yet glorious (3853-163249-0015)
david held it close in both of his saying gratefully thank you mother then fixing his eyes on the younger yet not dearer women he added with a ring in his voice that made their hearts answer with a prompt ay ay in spite of love or fear (3853-163249-0016)
the boys bless their brave hearts have done nobly but older men are needed now we cannot sacrifice all the gallant lads and we who have more to lose than they must take our turn and try to do as well (3853-163249-0017)
yes david sister and sweetheart answered bravely forgetting in the fervor of the moment what heavy consequences god might see fit to send good (3853-163249-0018)
bennet will take the garden and green house off my hands this autumn for a year or longer if i like (3853-163249-0019)
he's a kind neighborly man and his boy will take my place about the house and protect you faithfully (3853-163249-0020)
i knew you would go i saw you getting ready and i made up my mind to follow (3853-163249-0021)
you will let me do it and in return i will marry you whenever you ask me answered christie sealing the promise with a kiss that silenced him (3853-163249-0022)
you've something to tell me i see it in your face dear i must go (3853-163249-0023)
next evening as missus sterling sat alone in the twilight a tall man in army blue entered quietly stood watching the tranquil figure for a moment then went and knelt down beside it saying with a most unsoldierly choke in the voice (3853-163249-0024)
the loyal frenzy fell upon the three quiet women and they could not do too much for their country (3853-163249-0025)
it would have taken many knapsacks to hold all the gifts showered upon him by his friends and neighbors (3853-163249-0026)
finding that lisha showed little enthusiasm on the subject she tried to rouse him by patriotic appeals of various sorts (3853-163249-0027)
very well said missus wilkins resolutely to herself ef i can't make no impression on his soul i will on his stommick and see how that'll work (3853-163249-0028)
we can't afford no nice vittles now when our men are sufferin so (3853-163249-0029)
he was not as unmoved as he seemed by the general excitement and had felt sundry manly impulses to up and at em when his comrades in the shop discussed the crisis with ireful brandishing of awls and vengeful pounding of sole leather as if the rebels were under the hammer (3853-163249-0030)
to say that the fish rose at once and swallowed the bait hook and all but feebly expresses the justice done to the cakes by that long suffering man (3853-163249-0031)
can you remember what hepsey told us and call them poor long sufferin creeters names (3853-163249-0032)
no he ain't it's a trainer added ann lizy (3853-163249-0033)
now cynthy be you satisfied (3853-163249-0034)
and the inconsistent woman fell upon his buttony breast weeping copiously (3853-163249-0035)
his wife fed him with the fat of the land regardless of consequences his children revolved about him with tireless curiosity and wonder his neighbors flocked in to applaud advise and admire every one treated him with a respect most grateful to his feelings he was an object of interest and with every hour his importance increased so that by night he felt like a commander in chief and bore himself accordingly (3853-163249-0036)
then the good soul openly shouldered the burden she had borne so long in secret and bravely trudged on alone (3853-163249-0037)
the women dropped their work to look and listen for his visits were few and short and every instant was precious (3853-163249-0038)
they knew what it was without a word missus sterling clasped her hands and bowed her head (3853-163249-0039)
now let's be brave and enjoy every minute of it (3853-163249-0040)
we will what can i do for you davy asked christie wonderfully supported by the thought that she was going too (3853-163249-0041)
as a married woman you will get on better as my wife you will be allowed to come to me if i need you and as my he stopped there for he could not add as my widow you will have my pension to support you (3853-163249-0042)
nothing can part us any more not even death for love like ours will last for ever (3853-163249-0043)
not one david that's true love christie (3853-163249-0044)
then they stood quite still for a time and in the silence the two hearts talked together in the sweet language no tongue can utter (3853-163249-0045)
surely i shall if i give you and myself to the cause and i do it gladly though i know that my heart has got to ache as it never has ached yet when my courage fails as it will by and by and my selfish soul counts the cost of my offering after the excitement is over (3853-163249-0046)
david caught the exaltation and gave no further thought to any thing but the duty of the hour finding himself stronger and braver for that long look into the illuminated face of the woman he loved (3853-163249-0047)
the roses are for they remind me of poor helen and the first work i did with david was arranging flowers like these for a dead baby's little coffin (3853-163249-0048)
but i think few brides dress with a braver happier heart than mine though i do choose a sober wedding gown answered christie smiling again as she took from a half packed trunk her new hospital suit of soft gray woollen stuff (3853-163249-0049)
mister power is waiting are you ready love quite ready (3853-163249-0050)
you young folks take a wedding trip to the green house while we see how well we can get on without you (3853-163249-0051)
david and christie went smiling away together and if they shed any tears over the brief happiness no one saw them but the flowers and they loyally kept the secret folded up in their tender hearts (3853-163249-0052)
a very simple little marriage feast but more love good will and tender wishes adorned the plain table than is often found at wedding breakfasts and better than any speech or song was letty's broken whisper as she folded her arms round david's empty chair when no one saw her heaven bless and keep and bring him back to us (3853-163249-0053)
all watched with quickened breath and proud souls that living wave blue below and bright with a steely glitter above as it flowed down the street and away to join the sea of dauntless hearts that for months had rolled up against the south and ebbed back reddened with the blood of men like these (3853-163249-0054)
then she saw david and the regiment became one man to her (3853-163249-0055)
i could not love thee dear so much loved i not honor more (3853-163249-0056)
all idealisation makes life poorer (777-126732-0000)
then why indulge in prophetic phantasies (777-126732-0001)
at best they can only interpret the mind of the prophet and can have no objective value (777-126732-0002)
michaelis the ticket of leave apostle was speaking in an even voice a voice that wheezed as if deadened and oppressed by the layer of fat on his chest (777-126732-0003)
and ever since he had never managed to get his weight down as much as an ounce (777-126732-0004)
with his elbow presenting no appearance of a joint but more like a bend in a dummy's limb thrown over the back of a chair he leaned forward slightly over his short and enormous thighs to spit into the grate (777-126732-0005)
yes i had the time to think things out a little he added without emphasis (777-126732-0006)
when he rose painfully the thrusting forward of a skinny groping hand deformed by gouty swellings suggested the effort of a moribund murderer summoning all his remaining strength for a last stab (777-126732-0007)
his enunciation would have been almost totally unintelligible to a stranger (777-126732-0008)
the old terrorist turned slowly his head on his skinny neck from side to side (777-126732-0009)
and i could never get as many as three such men together (777-126732-0010)
the possessors of property had not only to face the awakened proletariat but they had also to fight amongst themselves yes (777-126732-0011)
struggle warfare was the condition of private ownership it was fatal (777-126732-0012)
ah he did not depend upon emotional excitement to keep up his belief no declamations no anger no visions of blood red flags waving or metaphorical lurid suns of vengeance rising above the horizon of a doomed society not he (777-126732-0013)
don't you think that if i had not been the optimist i am i could not have found in fifteen years some means to cut my throat (777-126732-0014)
very characteristic perfectly typical (777-126732-0017)
lombroso is an ass (777-126732-0020)
for him the criminal is the prisoner simple is it not (777-126732-0021)
there was an extraordinary force of suggestion in this posturing (777-126732-0022)
the famous terrorist had never in his life raised personally as much as his little finger against the social edifice (777-126732-0023)
the shadow of his evil gift clung to him yet like the smell of a deadly drug in an old vial of poison emptied now useless ready to be thrown away upon the rubbish heap of things that had served their time (777-126732-0024)
michaelis the ticket of leave apostle smiled vaguely with his glued lips his pasty moon face drooped under the weight of melancholy assent (777-126732-0025)
he had been a prisoner himself (777-126732-0026)
his own skin had sizzled under the red hot brand he murmured softly (777-126732-0027)
you don't understand he began disdainfully but stopped short intimidated by the dead blackness of the cavernous eyes in the face turned slowly towards him with a blind stare as if guided only by the sound (777-126732-0028)
he gave the discussion up with a slight shrug of the shoulders (777-126732-0029)
stevie accustomed to move about disregarded had got up from the kitchen table carrying off his drawing to bed with him (777-126732-0030)
the sheet of paper covered with circles dropped out of his fingers and he remained staring at the old terrorist as if rooted suddenly to the spot by his morbid horror and dread of physical pain (777-126732-0031)
his scared eyes blazed with indignation it would hurt terribly his mouth dropped open (777-126732-0032)
i don't say that protested michaelis gently (777-126732-0034)
his vision of truth had grown so intense that the sound of a strange voice failed to rout it this time (777-126732-0035)
the coals in the grate settled down with a slight crash and michaelis the hermit of visions in the desert of a penitentiary got up impetuously (777-126732-0036)
he paused then added with modest firmness (777-126732-0038)
i would call it cannibalistic that's what it is (777-126732-0039)
they are nourishing their greed on the quivering flesh and the warm blood of the people nothing else (777-126732-0040)
stevie swallowed the terrifying statement with an audible gulp and at once as though it had been swift poison sank limply in a sitting posture on the steps of the kitchen door (777-126732-0041)
he closed the door behind their backs with restrained violence turned the key shot the bolt (777-126732-0042)
he was not satisfied with his friends (777-126732-0043)
with the insight of a kindred temperament he pronounced his verdict (777-126732-0044)
there are natures too to whose sense of justice the price exacted looms up monstrously enormous odious oppressive worrying humiliating extortionate intolerable those are the fanatics (777-126732-0045)
in any case he had not the time (777-126732-0046)
loafing was all very well for these fellows who knew not mister vladimir and had women to fall back upon whereas he had a woman to provide for (777-126732-0047)
these were but few and for the first time since he opened his shop he took a commercial survey of its value (777-126732-0048)
this survey was unfavourable (777-126732-0049)
he took the cash box out of the drawer and turning to leave the shop became aware that stevie was still downstairs (777-126732-0050)
he looked dubiously at his brother in law but he did not ask him for information (777-126732-0051)
he stood still in the middle of the parlour and looked into the kitchen in silence (777-126732-0053)
he watched him gesticulating and murmuring in the kitchen (777-126732-0054)
stevie prowled round the table like an excited animal in a cage (777-126732-0055)
the light thrown down by the shade fell dazzlingly on the white pillow sunk by the weight of her head reposing with closed eyes and dark hair done up in several plaits for the night (777-126732-0056)
her bare feet as if poked through the bottom of an unadorned sleeved calico sack buttoned tightly at neck and wrists felt over the rug for the slippers while she looked upward into her husband's face (777-126732-0057)
there is no occupation that fails a man more completely than that of a secret agent of police (777-126732-0058)
it's like your horse suddenly falling dead under you in the midst of an uninhabited and thirsty plain (777-126732-0059)
the prospect was as black as the window pane against which he was leaning his forehead (777-126732-0061)
yes not at all well (777-126732-0062)
down below in the quiet narrow street measured footsteps approached the house then died away unhurried and firm as if the passer by had started to pace out all eternity from gas lamp to gas lamp in a night without end and the drowsy ticking of the old clock on the landing became distinctly audible in the bedroom (777-126732-0063)
that poor boy is in a very excited state to night she murmured after a pause which lasted for three ticks of the clock (777-126732-0064)
this dread led him to make the remark that stevie had disregarded his suggestion to go to bed (777-126732-0065)
there was no young man of his age in london more willing and docile than stephen she affirmed none more affectionate and ready to please and even useful as long as people did not upset his poor head (777-126732-0066)
that boy hears too much of what is talked about here (777-126732-0068)
if i had known they were coming to night i would have seen to it that he went to bed at the same time i did (777-126732-0069)
he was out of his mind with something he overheard about eating people's flesh and drinking blood what's the good of talking like that (777-126732-0070)
he isn't fit to hear what's said here he believes it's all true (777-126732-0073)
he knows no better he gets into his passions over it (777-126732-0074)
he glared at me as if he didn't know who i was when i went downstairs (777-126732-0075)
he gets a red face poring over them (777-126732-0077)
i wouldn't give a halfpenny for the whole lot (777-126732-0078)
the other day stevie got hold of one and there was a story in it of a german soldier officer tearing half off the ear of a recruit and nothing was done to him for it the brute (777-126732-0079)
he can't stand the notion of any cruelty (777-126732-0080)
comfortable dear (777-126732-0081)
